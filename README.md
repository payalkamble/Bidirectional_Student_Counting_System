This IoT-based project uses an ESP8266 microcontroller and IR sensors to accurately count students entering and exiting a classroom. It features a bidirectional counting system to maintain the real-time number of students present. Data is processed and updated continuously. The Blynk app displays the live count and sends notifications to authorized users. This system enables remote monitoring for teachers and administrators, improving classroom management and safety.
